A Bengali-Assamese script font face dedicated to rendering Pāḷi text.

Major features that differ from existing Bengali font faces:

1. Facilitates the use of the letter `ৰ U+09F0` as the Pāḷi consonant `ba`, prevents the letter from rendering the glyph as a ligature of `r` due to its use in Assamese language.
2. Additional glyph for the Pāḷi consonant cluster `ñña` (`ঞ্ঞ U+099EU+09CDU+099E`)
3. Additional glyphs for the Pāḷi consonant `ḷa` (`ল় U+09B2U+09BC`)
